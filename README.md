I am a geographical engineer and master in computer engineering at the University of Santiago. I love to travel, take photos (which you can see on my Flickr page at https://www.flickr.com/photos/pedrinnnnn), and play video games.

I am currently working as data engineer at European Sourthen Observatory.

I enjoy working with databases, data analysis, and data science (especially the geographic versions of these fields). 

**In terms of personal interests:**

-  I am currently learning Kafka, InfluxDB and grafana.
-  I am interested in ecological research.
-  My BSc thesis focused on ecological connectivity analysis using satellite imagery, PostGIS for data processing, PgRouting for routing algorithms and Python to automate the whole project.  
-  My MEng thesis focused on simulation and automation of socioecological risk assessment for Harmful Algal Bloom using PostGIS and Python.     
-  If you'd like to contact me, you can email me at pedropablosilvaa@gmail.com."
