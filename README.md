I am a geographical engineer ending my master in informatic engineering at University of Santiago. I love to travel, take [photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pedrinnnnn) and play video games.

Currently working as data engineering at Entel Ocean, IT digital unit of National Telecommunications Enterprise (ENTEL). I like to work with databases, data analysis and data science (and geo-version of those).
  

**Talking about Personal Stuffs:**

-  I’m currently working in Entel Ocean as data engineer.
